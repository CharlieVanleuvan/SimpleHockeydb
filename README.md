This folder contains the basic SQL commands used as part of an introductory DBA course in SQL server. A simple hockey stats database was created for Syracuse University IST 659

## Project Overview
A local college hockey team wants to establish itself as the premier team in the Northeast. They play games weekly from September through March, and if they finish at the top of their division, they have a chance to make it to the national tournament to face off against the best teams in the country. The competition is fierce, so recruiting the best players is a major focus. Part of the appeal for college hockey players is the “professional” feel of keeping accurate stats on games and players, such as goals, assists, and penalty minutes. This also allows the team to use data to make lineup choices and prepare for upcoming games. Currently, the stats for all games and players are recorded on paper, with no online record of game stats or a player’s total points scored throughout the season. To encourage team growth, appeal to new recruits, and potentially improve game strategy, the team has decided to hire a database administrator to create a database for the team to store data throughout the season.  

Please review the accompanying .sql files and written report for further details on how this simple DB was created and mock data inserted.
